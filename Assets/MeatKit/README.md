This project contains the sample scenes and prefabs for MeatKit, the Unity Editor toolkit for creating custom scenes, guns, and mods for H3VR.

## Atlas Sample Scene
### Example areas
* **Prefabs**: such as the player spawn / reset points, item spawner, sosig spawner, object spawner, and destructobin.
* **PMat**: PMat is the component used to define the projectile properties of your scene's geometry, as well as bullet impact effects.
* **Interactions**: Ladders, ziplines, and more forms of interactive objects.
* **Unity Layers**: Showcasing the properties of different layers and their uses, as well as an example of combining the layers to create composites.
* **Reverb Environments**: Apply different reverb effects to your scene for larger / smaller areas

### Minigames
* **Capture The Flag**: In the capture the flag minigame, you are able to grab and capture the flag from the opposing team's base! It's effectively more like a Team Deathmatch mode though since Sosigs will never actually capture the flag themselves.
* **Popup Targets**: In the popup targets minigame 5 targets will pop up for you to shoot. Once they're all hit, they will wait a random amount of time before 5 more popup again.
